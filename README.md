# CSV-Annotator
An app for annotating CSV Files using Streamlit. Just bored with the sheets and excel for annnotating data, this can help annotaters to interaactively annotate the sentences.

Working :

The app takes a csv file as input, the code detects the sentences column as 'Content' (Hard-coded 😐). Then, we can use options to annotate if the senetence is 
positive or negative. You can modify the code for your usage. I've added all the necessary documentation in the code itself.

Used : Streamlit (entirely), a bit of pandas too.
